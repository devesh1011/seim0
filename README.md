## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install seim0
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

# Required for on-chain transactions
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_or_openai_api_key"
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```typescript
import { MemoryClient } from "seim0";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  "https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com"
);

const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const memory = new MemoryClient({
  network: "testnet",
  signer: signer,
  llm: {
    provider: "google",
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
      model: "gemini-2.0-flash",
    },
  },
  embedder: {
    provider: "google",
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
      model: "text-embedding-004",
    },
  },
});
```

### 3. Adding Memories

```typescript
// Add a memory to the blockchain
const conversation = [
  {
    role: "user" as const,
    content:
      "Hi, I'm David and I work as a blockchain developer at Ethereum Foundation. I specialize in smart contract security and love DeFi protocols.",
  },
  {
    role: "assistant" as const,
    content:
      "Nice to meet you David! Smart contract security is crucial in DeFi. What are your favorite protocols to work with?",
  },
  {
    role: "user" as const,
    content:
      "I really enjoy working with Uniswap and Compound. I also contribute to OpenZeppelin's security audits on weekends.",
  },
];

const result = await memory.add(conversation, {
  user_id: "david_blockchain_dev",
  metadata: {
    session: "test_fact_extraction",
    project: "sei_memory_test",
  },
});

console.log("Memory stored on blockchain!");
console.log("Transaction Hash:", memoryResult.txHash);
console.log("IPFS CID:", memoryResult.cid);
```

### 4. Searching Memories

```typescript
// Search memories on the blockchain
const searchResults = await memory.search(query, {
  user_id: "david_blockchain_dev",
  limit: 3,
});

console.log(`Found ${searchResults.length} memories:`);
searchResults.forEach((memory, index) => {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${memory.memory}`);
});
```

### 5. Getting All Memories

```typescript
// Get all memories for a user
const allMemories = await memory.getAll({
  user_id: "david_blockchain_dev",
});
console.log(`Total memories: ${allMemories.length}`);
```

## üß† Short-Term Memory

Short-term memory in Seim0 refers to recent conversational context and facts that are immediately available for retrieval and reasoning by AI agents. These are typically stored off-chain and are not yet committed to decentralized storage or the blockchain, allowing for fast, ephemeral access.

```typescript
// Add a short-term memory (ephemeral, not yet on-chain)
const shortTermConversation = [
  { role: "user" as const, content: "Remind me to call Bob at 5pm." },
];

// Store in-memory or in a local vector store for quick recall
await memory.add(shortTermConversation, {
  user_id: "alice_temp",
  metadata: { session: "reminders", temporary: true },
  // Optionally, use a memory backend that does not persist to blockchain/IPFS
});

// Retrieve short-term memory
const reminders = await memory.search("call Bob", {
  user_id: "alice_temp",
  limit: 1,
});
console.log(reminders[0]?.memory);
```

Short-term memories can be periodically consolidated or promoted to long-term memory if they are deemed important.

## üß† Short-Term Memory

Short-term memory in Seim0 refers to recent conversational context and facts that are immediately available for retrieval and reasoning by AI agents. These are typically scoped to a specific run or workflow using `runId`, and are not yet committed to decentralized storage or the blockchain, allowing for fast, ephemeral access.

```typescript
// Add a short-term memory (ephemeral, scoped to a run/workflow)
const shortTermConversation = [
  { role: "user" as const, content: "Remind me to call Bob at 5pm." },
];

// Store with a runId for session/workflow scoping
await memory.add(shortTermConversation, {
  user_id: "alice_temp",
  runId: "reminder_run_001",
  metadata: { temporary: true },
  // Optionally, use a memory backend that does not persist to blockchain/IPFS
});

// Retrieve short-term memory for this run
const reminders = await memory.search("call Bob", {
  user_id: "alice_temp",
  runId: "reminder_run_001",
  limit: 1,
});
console.log(reminders[0]?.memory);
```

Short-term memories can be periodically consolidated or promoted to long-term memory if they are deemed important.

## üóÉÔ∏è Long-Term Memory

Long-term memory in Seim0 consists of important, structured facts and knowledge that are persisted across sessions and users. These are pinned to IPFS and indexed on the Sei blockchain, ensuring durability, auditability, and decentralized access.

```typescript
// Add a long-term memory (persisted on-chain and IPFS)
const longTermConversation = [
  { role: "user" as const, content: "My passport number is X1234567." },
  {
    role: "assistant" as const,
    content: "I've saved your passport number securely.",
  },
];

const result = await memory.add(longTermConversation, {
  user_id: "alice",
  metadata: { session: "identity", importance: "high" },
  // By default, Seim0 will persist this to IPFS and index on Sei
});

console.log("Memory stored on blockchain!");
console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.txHash);
console.log("IPFS CID:", result.cid);

// Retrieve long-term memory
const identityFacts = await memory.search("passport number", {
  user_id: "alice",
  limit: 1,
});
console.log(identityFacts[0]?.memory);
```

Long-term memories are tamper-proof, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible, making them ideal for critical knowledge and persistent facts.

## üóÉÔ∏è Long-Term Memory

Long-term memory in Seim0 consists of important, structured facts and knowledge that are persisted globally across all runs and sessions for a user. These are pinned to IPFS and indexed on the Sei blockchain, ensuring durability, auditability, and decentralized access. Long-term memories do not require a `runId` and are preserved beyond any single session or workflow.

```typescript
// Add a long-term memory (persisted on-chain and IPFS, global for the user)
const longTermConversation = [
  { role: "user" as const, content: "My passport number is X1234567." },
  {
    role: "assistant" as const,
    content: "I've saved your passport number securely.",
  },
];

const result = await memory.add(longTermConversation, {
  user_id: "alice",
  metadata: { importance: "high" },
  // By default, Seim0 will persist this to IPFS and index on Sei
});

console.log("Memory stored on blockchain!");
console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.txHash);
console.log("IPFS CID:", result.cid);

// Retrieve long-term memory (no runId needed)
const identityFacts = await memory.search("passport number", {
  user_id: "alice",
  limit: 1,
});
console.log(identityFacts[0]?.memory);
```

Long-term memories are tamper-proof, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible, making them ideal for critical knowledge and persistent facts.

## üîß Configuration

That's it! The package automatically handles:

‚úÖ **Network Selection**: Just specify `"testnet"` or `"mainnet"`  
‚úÖ **Smart Contracts**: Pre-deployed contracts are used automatically  
‚úÖ **IPFS Gateway**: Your Pinata credentials are used for storage  
‚úÖ **Blockchain RPC**: Optimal RPC endpoints are selected automatically

No contract addresses, no RPC URLs, no complex setup needed!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Seim0 uses a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Pre-deployed contracts handle:
   - Memory indexing and metadata management
   - Access control and permissions
   - Transaction fees and payments

2. **IPFS Storage**: Your Pinata account stores:
   - Decentralized content storage
   - Immutable content addressing
   - Global accessibility

3. **Blockchain Integration**: Sei testnet/mainnet provides:
   - Fast transaction processing
   - Immutable transaction history
   - Cryptographic verification
